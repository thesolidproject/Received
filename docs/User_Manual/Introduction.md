# Workflow Widget

## Documentation Introduction

**Date last Modified: 15 May 2017**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

This project was built for Northrop Grumman with a target to present data in workflow diagrams similarly to their excel generated sheets, in addition to tracking particular states of products as they maneuver through the manufacturing line.

### Project Initialization

To begin, this documentation follows these assumptions based on current record of scope and requirements:

- [Angular2](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) is installed
- [D3](https://d3js.org) is installed
- Project is downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/jstngoulet/vorteksolutions)

  - Please contact team leader for repository access, if required.

### Running the Project

Once all of the files are downloaded and configured, per the setup requirements of your organization and that of the library, we may now see the working project in action.

In your preferred command terminal, change the parent working directory (PWD) to the current project's directory. This is a directory within the project repository.

`cd ~/docs/code/ang2`

Now that the PWD is assigned, we can now initialize a local server to build the project. Run the command:

`ng serve`

Then, in an organization approved browser, navigate to

`http://localhost:4200/`

The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files while the window is open.

Your project is now running in a view-only state. For quick Angular commands that may be useful for this project, they have been included [here]('Angular_q_tips.md') while full documentation can be viewed at the library's wiki, found from the Angular2 repository link above.
