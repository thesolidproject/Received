# Workflow Widget

## User Documentation

**Date last Modified: 15 May 2017**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

The workflow widget was designed to make viewing the manufacturing states a breeze as it can highlight critical states and inform you on where bottlenecks are occurring. This is a simple tutorial of how to use this widget, which may be expanded as it advances.

### Main View

When you first load the application, you are greeted with a flourish view, which shows all of the states available on your screen. At a glance, you may quickly see which states require attention and which are on the right track. The table below shows you the color and the meaning:

Color  | Description
------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Green  | No errors or bottlenecks found. This state is in the clear.
Yellow | Minor errors found. These states need to be reviewed but are not system critical.
Red    | Critical Errors found in state and require immediate attention.

### Switching Views

To switch between themes, there is a quick menu at the top left of your screen. You have 2 options: Simple and Flourish View.

#### Simple View

The simple view has solely the color of the state and the state name. To find more information, the state may be clicked. This view is for those that just want a quick glance at what is going on in the workflow.

#### Flourish View

The flourish view has the same items as the simple view, but also states the schedule (whether it is on time or not) and the cost of the state. The detail view in this theme is also more advanced as it shows the information in a table fashion

### Detail Views

By hovering over a node, you can easily see the current progress and the description of the state.

Bu clicking the node, you will be presented with a larger view, showing more in-depth information. This larger view may soon be replaced with a form, in which you may edit the data you see.
