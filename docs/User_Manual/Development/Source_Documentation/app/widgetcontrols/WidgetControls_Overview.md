### Introduction

The widget controls component is the menu that lives above the widget. This component only has 4 buttons: Simple, Flourish, User and Admin.

### Controlling the Events

To control the events, each button has its own handler. For our project, 2 were implemented: showSimple() and showFlourish(). Each show their relative page, handled by the WorkflowService object.
