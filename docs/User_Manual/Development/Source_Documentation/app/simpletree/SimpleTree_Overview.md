# Workflow Widget

## Simple Tree Overview

**Date last Modified: 15 May 2017**

### Introduction

This component was created to implement a very broadly-scoped workflow diagram that solely shows the name, and the current quality (noted by the color).

Due to the slight variations of this class, please see the full documentation the the **WorkflowTree** Component, located in the parent app folder. The styling functionality is the same.
